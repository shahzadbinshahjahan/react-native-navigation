# React Native Navigation README

Welcome to my React Native application! This application provides a basic implementation of navigation in a scalable manner.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Expo CLI**: Install the Expo CLI globally on your machine by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   npm install -g expo-cli
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:shahzadbinshahjahan/react-native-navigation.git
   ```

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your directory to the cloned repository:

   ```
   cd react-native-navigation
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the application using Expo. Follow these steps:

1. **Start the Development Server**: Start the Expo development server by running the following command:

   ```
   npm run start
   ```

2. **View the Application**: After running the command above, Expo will open a new tab in your default web browser displaying a QR code. You can scan this QR code using the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device to view the application.

   Alternatively, you can press `a` to open the application in an Android emulator, or `i` to open it in an iOS simulator if you have them set up.

3. **Interact with the Application**: Once the application is running, you can interact with it on your device or emulator/simulator.

## Generating an APK

To generate an APK for your React Native Expo application, you can follow the steps outlined in this [guide](https://dev.to/chinmaymhatre/how-to-generate-apk-using-react-native-expo-kae). It provides detailed instructions on how to create an APK file for Android devices.
